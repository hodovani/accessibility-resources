# Web Accessibility Resources
A list of favorite resources.  Please make an issue or PR to add!

## Introductory materials about why this is important and what it means

This is a place to start if you're not familiar with web accessibility.  It's also a good list of resources to send to your boss, coworker, or vendor if they give you a blank stare when you say something like "keyboard navigability."

## Checklists

In my experience, checklists are the most effective way to audit your code base and catch bugs.

  -   [Resources for different roles on a team](https://accessibility.digital.gov/) (content, UX, etc)

  -   [Checklist from federal tech agency 18F](https://accessibility.18f.gov/checklist/)

  -   [Easy checks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/)

## Manual tools and screen readers

## Automated tools

Automated tools are useful to catch issues that a computer can detect programmatically like color contrast and header level, but catch only about 30% of accessibility issues.

  -   [WAVE - checks a URL you enter](https://wave.webaim.org/) (warning: automated tools sometimes give false positives or false negatives, so it's still important to review things ourselves)

  -   [axe from Deque](https://www.deque.com/axe/) - the Chrome extension is what I use

  -   [Color contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=FFFFFF&bcolor=FDD835)

  -   [How to use a Mac's built-in screen reader](https://webaim.org/articles/voiceover/#reading)

  - [How to use NVDA](https://webaim.org/articles/nvda/)

## Data visualization, maps, and SVG

## User research resources

Team familiarity with the guidelines, regular internal audits, and automated tools can help you design with accessibility in mind and catch bugs that you are introducing to the code base.  But only user research will tell you if what you're building truly works for everyone.
